# 🌟 JoyPop - Bite-Sized Happiness

> A delightful wellbeing app that transforms moments of joy, gratitude, and kindness into a visual collection of glowing stars.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

In our fast-paced world, moments of joy and gratitude often slip by unnoticed. Traditional journaling feels overwhelming, and existing wellbeing apps are cluttered with features that create friction rather than delight. People need a simple, magical way to capture and celebrate life's small wins without the burden of lengthy entries or complex interfaces.

---

## 💡 The Solution

JoyPop reimagines wellbeing tracking as a playful, emotion-first experience. Instead of endless text fields, users collect luminous stars in a beautiful glass jar—each representing a moment of **savouring**, **gratitude**, or **kindness**. With a 30-second mindfulness timer, 80-character micro-reflections, and physics-based animations, JoyPop makes happiness tracking feel like a game, not a chore.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🫙 Interactive Joy Jar
A stunning glassmorphic jar that fills with glowing stars as you capture moments. Watch your happiness accumulate with smooth physics-based animations and reactive visual feedback.

### ⏰ Mindful Savouring
A unique 30-second hold-to-savour interaction that encourages you to pause, breathe, and truly appreciate the present moment before capturing it.

### 🎨 Three Types of Stars
- **🌸 Savouring** (Pink) - Moments of presence and appreciation
- **❤️ Kindness** (Purple) - Acts of compassion and generosity
- **🙏 Gratitude** (Yellow) - Things you're thankful for

### 📱 Progressive Web App
Install JoyPop on any device for a native app experience. Works offline, loads instantly, and feels premium on mobile and desktop.

### 🔐 Privacy-First Design
Your reflections are encrypted server-side using PostgreSQL's pgcrypto. Complete account deletion available anytime. No tracking, no ads, no data selling.

### 🏺 Jar Collection Gallery
Save completed jars (60 stars) with custom names and revisit your happiness journey anytime through the beautiful gallery view.
